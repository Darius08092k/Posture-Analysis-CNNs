# Posture-Analysis-CNNs (Code can be provided)

The Posture Classification project utilizes MATLAB's built-in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images of correct and incorrect postures. By training and testing with multiple images depicting correct posture, incorrect head posture, and incorrect back posture of a single individual, this project aims to accurately classify and analyze different posture scenarios.

Key Features:

CNN Models: The project utilizes MATLAB's pre-trained CNN models, including GoogLeNet, AlexNet, and ResNet, for image classification tasks. These models have been fine-tuned to classify posture images with high accuracy.

Multi-Class Classification: Images of correct posture, incorrect head posture, and incorrect back posture are classified into three distinct classes using the trained CNN models. This allows for detailed analysis and classification of different posture scenarios.

Data Preprocessing: Prior to training the CNN models, the input images undergo preprocessing techniques such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance model performance and generalization.

Performance Evaluation: The project includes evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the trained CNN models, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This enables quantitative analysis of the classification results.

Visualization: The project provides visualization tools to inspect the CNN models' predictions, including confusion matrices, ROC curves, and class activation maps, facilitating deeper insights into the classification process.
